## about this project

We want to study air-sea fluxes by modelling the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) using [Oceananigans](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/). This is a 21st Century Weather + Greg + Callum project.  

## science goals

Our short/medium term goal is to understand the aggregate effect of submesoscale ocean features on atmospheric boundary layer structure and air-sea fluxes. We are working towards air-sea flux parameterisations that are robust to changes in model resolution. 

## approach

Idealised model of the MABL with prescribed SST (& u, v?) variability at submeso-scales $\mathcal{O}$(0.1-1km), focusing on (convectively) unstable conditions.
- domain $\mathcal{O}(10\mathrm{km})$ long/wide and $\mathcal{O}(500\mathrm{m})$ high

## about this repo
Trialing this repo as a project management tool. It's private at the moment. I envisage that we will invite the other collaborators when there's something for them to look at and, at some point, make it public.
